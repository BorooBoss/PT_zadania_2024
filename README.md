## General
**This should not represent any project.** PT (Programming Techniques) is subject from university I visit. Goal of the subject was to slowly but surely move from C to CPP. In the first few exercises it was not even clear CPP
because we used some functions from C but with some time we managed to get to CPP smoothly. Tasks were small, the solutions were mostly some algorithms which I think can be easily found on the internet and they are not 
nesseary to be memorized by heart. It was fun to get to know this language but sometimes it felt like we used so many different functions with same meaning only because we can do that.
 ### Some of the task areas    
 Function overloading  
 Stack, Queue    
 Bubble sort, Insertion sort, Quick sort, Merge sort  
 Heap sort  
 Object, Class, Constructor, Destructor  
 Array, Vector, Iterator, Deque, Map...  
 Deep search, Width search, Shortest path in a graph, Dijkstra's algorithm  
 Lambda, Emplace, Template, Smart pointers...
